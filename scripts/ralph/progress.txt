# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- FastAPI entry point is `app/main.py` with Jinja2 templates in `app/templates` and static assets in `app/static`.
- Pre-made product data is currently defined in `app/data.py` for listing and detail views.
- Cart state is stored client-side in localStorage under `teaAlchemyCart` and rendered via `app/static/cart.js`.
- Custom blend selections persist in localStorage under `teaAlchemyBlend` and are managed by `app/static/blend.js`.
- Base tea alignment data is modeled in `app/data.py` with `BlendBase` and `BLEND_OUTCOME_AXES` for the custom blend builder.
- Functional botanicals are modeled in `APP/data.py` and stored in `teaAlchemyBlend.selectedBotanicals`, with alignment previews combining base + botanical contributions in `APP/static/blend.js`.
- Outcome visualization is rendered as an SVG radar chart in `APP/static/blend.js`, driven by `BLEND_OUTCOME_AXES`.

Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: FastAPI storefront with pre-made product listing and detail pages, plus in-memory product catalog with outcomes, sizes, and pricing
- Files changed: app/main.py, app/data.py, app/templates/index.html, app/templates/product_detail.html, app/static/styles.css, app/db.py, app/requirements.txt, app/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Product data is rendered via Jinja2 templates from `app/data.py`
  - Static assets are served from `app/static` and referenced in templates
  - No automated tests yet; `python -m compileall app` used as a syntax check
  - Browser verification pending; dev-browser skill not available in this session

Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: Added client-side cart behavior on product detail with add-to-cart buttons per size and live cart summary
- Files changed: app/templates/product_detail.html, app/static/styles.css, app/static/cart.js, app/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cart UI lives on the product detail page and reads/writes localStorage under `teaAlchemyCart`
  - Cart rendering happens client-side in `app/static/cart.js`

Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: Custom blend step 1 outcome selection with outcome cards, preview panel, and localStorage persistence
- Files changed: app/data.py, app/main.py, app/templates/custom_blend.html, app/static/blend.js, app/static/styles.css, app/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Outcome selection data is sourced from `app/data.py` and stored in localStorage under `teaAlchemyBlend`
  - Preview panel content updates client-side in `app/static/blend.js`

Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: Added base tea selection step with outcome-aligned base cards, alignment visualization, and persistence in blend flow
- Files changed: APP/data.py, APP/main.py, APP/templates/custom_blend.html, APP/static/blend.js, APP/static/styles.css, APP/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Base tea alignment data is sourced from `APP/data.py` via `BlendBase` and `BLEND_OUTCOME_AXES`
  - Base selection UI renders per-outcome grids and stores selection in localStorage under `teaAlchemyBlend`

Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: Added functional botanicals step with selectable botanical cards, compatibility filtering by base, and real-time outcome alignment updates that combine base + botanical contributions
- Files changed: APP/data.py, APP/templates/custom_blend.html, APP/static/styles.css, APP/static/blend.js, APP/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Functional botanical data now includes attributes and outcome contribution values in `APP/data.py`
  - Botanical selections are persisted in `teaAlchemyBlend.selectedBotanicals` and filtered by base selection in `APP/static/blend.js`

Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: Added SVG radar chart outcome visualization with alertness axis, dynamic updates based on base + botanicals, and numeric score list
- Files changed: APP/data.py, APP/templates/custom_blend.html, APP/static/blend.js, APP/static/styles.css, APP/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Outcome axes now use Alertness in `BLEND_OUTCOME_AXES`; keep alignment keys in sync with visualization labels
  - Radar chart UI is built in `APP/static/blend.js` and styled in `APP/static/styles.css`
