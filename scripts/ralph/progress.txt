# Ralph Progress Log
## Codebase Patterns
- FastAPI entry point is `app/main.py` with Jinja2 templates in `app/templates` and static assets in `app/static`.
- Pre-made product data is currently defined in `app/data.py` for listing and detail views.

- What was implemented: FastAPI storefront with pre-made product listing and detail pages, plus in-memory product catalog with outcomes, sizes, and pricing
- Files changed: app/main.py, app/data.py, app/templates/index.html, app/templates/product_detail.html, app/static/styles.css, app/db.py, app/requirements.txt, app/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Product data is rendered via Jinja2 templates from `app/data.py`
  - Static assets are served from `app/static` and referenced in templates
  - No automated tests yet; `python -m compileall app` used as a syntax check
  - Browser verification pending; dev-browser skill not available in this session
