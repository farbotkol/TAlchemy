## Codebase Patterns
- Templates and static assets live under `app/templates` and `app/static`; use lowercase `app` imports/paths.

Thread: N/A
- Added Bootstrap 5 CSS and JS bundle includes across all Jinja templates so base styling and interactive components are available globally.
- Files changed: APP/templates/cart.html, APP/templates/checkout.html, APP/templates/confirmation.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step1.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step2.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step3.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step4.html, APP/templates/index.html, APP/templates/product_detail.html, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Bootstrap includes live in each template head/footer today rather than a shared base template.
  - The repository tracks both APP and app directories on disk; template edits land under APP.

Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: Rebuilt the homepage layout using Bootstrap container/row/card utilities with Bootstrap typography and buttons; corrected the FastAPI import path to use the lowercase `app` package; updated app agent notes to reference the lowercase `app` paths; browser verified the homepage at http://127.0.0.1:8010/ and captured `~/.codex/skills/dev-browser/tmp/tea-home.png`.
- Files changed: app/templates/index.html, app/main.py, app/AGENTS.md, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: Homepage cards now use Bootstrap `card` with `btn btn-warning` CTAs for consistency.
  - Gotchas encountered: dev-browser expects Playwright caches under `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on macOS.
  - Useful context: Uvicorn ran successfully on port 8010 for browser verification.
