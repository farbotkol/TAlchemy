## Codebase Patterns
- Templates are stored under `APP/templates` (the repo also has an `app` directory, but tracked templates live in `APP`).

Thread: N/A
- Added Bootstrap 5 CSS and JS bundle includes across all Jinja templates so base styling and interactive components are available globally.
- Files changed: APP/templates/cart.html, APP/templates/checkout.html, APP/templates/confirmation.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step1.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step2.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step3.html, APP/templates/custom_blend_step4.html, APP/templates/index.html, APP/templates/product_detail.html, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Bootstrap includes live in each template head/footer today rather than a shared base template.
  - The repository tracks both APP and app directories on disk; template edits land under APP.
