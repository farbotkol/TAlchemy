Thread: N/A
- What was implemented: scaffolded FastAPI app with base template loading Bootstrap 5 CSS/JS and custom styles, plus a starter homepage using Bootstrap components.
- Files changed: app/main.py, app/db.py, app/templates/base.html, app/templates/index.html, app/static/styles.css, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: base template is the canonical place to include Bootstrap assets.
  - Gotchas encountered: Python is available as `python3` in the environment.
  - Useful context: `app/static/styles.css` is loaded after Bootstrap for brand overrides.
